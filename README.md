# Final Project - Field and Service Robotics

Welcome to the final project for the **Field and Service Robotics** course!

## 🛸 Project Description

This project focuses on the **control of a quadcopter** and includes:

- Three different types of controllers ✨
- Option to enable/disable a **momentum-based estimator** 🔧
- Option to enable/disable **ground** and **ceiling** effects 🌍🔝
- In some simulations, **obstacle collision detection** is included 🚧

The system is designed to test different scenarios and operating conditions of the drone in a simulated environment.

## ▶️ How to Run

To run a simulation:

1. Open the file `main_trajectory.m`
2. Go to its **line 293**
3. Follow the instructions to select the type of simulation you want to run
4. Hit *Run* and enjoy the flight! 🚁

## ℹ️ Notes

This README isn't entirely our own work... We got a little help from **ChatGPT** 😅

Have fun and happy simulating!
